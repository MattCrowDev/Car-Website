            <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
            <p>
                After winning the 1979 WRC manufacturer title, Ford completely abandoned competition to concentrate on developing a new rally car for the upcoming Group B category. Their new rally weapon was originally intended to be the rear wheel drive Escort RS1700T but when the car’s conception was finished the winning standard was already shifting to four wheel drive. At first, there was provisions to adapt the car to four wheel drive but in early 1983 Ford decided to abandon over two years of work developing the RS1700T and started anew.
            </p>
            <h1>HISTORY</h1>
            <p>
                The RS200 was unlike any of its production car based competition–which included the Peugeot 205 T16, Lancia Delta S4 and the Audi Quattro S1 among others–and yet, it was somehow cooler for it.

                Per the FIA's requirements, Ford had to build 200 road cars to homologate the RS200 for Group B competition. When we drove a race-spec RS200 back in 1986, Ford told us it intended on building more than 200 roadgoing RS200s, though that never happened.
                
                Being a tiny mid-engined car designed for rally, the RS200 feels somewhat like a spiritual successor to the Lancia Stratos. It was was designed by Filippo Sano at Ghia and its fiberglass bodywork was built by Reliant. Yes, that Reliant.
                
                Mechanically, though, it's wildly different than the Stratos. Tony Southgate–an F1 designer who later went on to devise the Le Mans-winning Jaguar XJR-9–designed the RS200's tubular space frame chassis, which used dual shocks at each corner.
                The drivetrain was arguably the wildest element of the RS200. It used a 1.8-liter Cosworth BDT four-cylinder engine mounted in the middle, but bizarrely, the gearbox was mounted near the front axle. Power was then sent back to a central differential with three different rear-to-front torque split settings, 50/50, 67/33 and 100/0.

                Journalist Chris Harris describes this setup as "like a Nissan GT-R going backwards," in a  /DRIVE  video. This unusual setup contributed to a perfect 50/50 weight distribution, a low polar moment of inertia. In handling terms, this means the RS200 is incredibly nimble.
                The RS200 was frighteningly quick too. In road-spec, the turbocharged Cosworth engine made about 250-hp, but in Group B-spec, it made anywhere from 380-hp to 450-hp. In some wilder racing variants, the RS200 allegedly made around 650-hp to 800-hp and could sprint from 0-60 mph in 2.1 seconds.

                For car geeks, the RS200 is the stuff of legends, but in many ways, it was ultimately a failure. In Group B competition, it was a victim of bad timing.

                The RS200 made its competition debut in 1986, where it showed a lot of promise in the face of its intense competition. The things made Group B rallying exciting–wildly powerful cars and spectators that couldn't get enough of them–made it extraordinarily dangerous. Tragedy struck at the 1986 Rally Portugal when Joaquim Santos, driving an RS200, lost control and spun his car into a crowd, killing three spectators. 

                Later that same race, a Lancia Delta S4 driven by Henri Toivonen and Sergio Cresto ran off the road and burned to the ground, killing the driver and co-driver. This effectively ended Group B, with the RS200 never reaching its potential. It did, however, find later success in rallycross and hill climbs like Pikes Peak. Still, it wasn't the game changer Ford hoped it would be.
                The road car didn't find much love either, only being appreciated years after production ended. By most accounts, it was way too rough to daily drive and the build quality was sub-par at best, though that was somewhat to be expected of cars built only to fill a homologation requirement.

                The fact that an RS200 was more expensive than a Ferrari 328 didn't help its case much either. To buy this car new, you had to have deep pockets and an understanding of what made it special. The last road car was bought in 1994, according to RM Sotheby's, meaning it sat for eight years after it was built.

                That said, the RS200 is easily one of the most loved cars of the Group B era. Its combination of wild design and even wilder engineering tick all the right boxes for car enthusiast.
