            <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
            <p>
                In 1983, Audi had anticipated that they would not be able to rely solely on their traction advantage and overwhelming 
                horsepower to win rallies for much longer. In mid-1984 their predictions rang true with the arrival of the smaller,
                purpose-built, mid-engined, and four-wheel driven Peugeot 205 T16. The quattro in comparison was large, front heavy, 
                and suffered from crippling understeer in most driving situations. To fix this, most of the engineers at Ingolstadt 
                proposed that they should design and build a totally new Group B car from scratch. However, Audi’s top brass was not 
                keen to the idea since it would have given bad press to their flagship quattro model. Hoping to save face, the car had 
                to be “fixed” and improved substantially, but not replaced. The answer was to be the Sport quattro.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h1>HISTORY</h1>
            <p>
                In hopes to fix the quattro’s handling woes, the Audi engineers proposed to shorten its wheelbase by 320 mm (12.6″). 
                In theory, doing this should greatly enhance turn-in capabilities and also reducing weight in the process (which meant
                overall better performance). The project was approved and the quattro underwent a major overhaul to make it a more capable 
                rally car. Shortening the wheelbase on a car who’s engine sits over or forward of the front axle actually worsens weight 
                bias towards a front heavy vehicle. This was proven when the press got their hands on its first Sport quattro homologation 
                model: it tipped the scales at 62.1% over the front axle (the old quattro had 60%). However, the wheelbase being very short 
                makes for a quicker turn-in and greatly reduces rear stability which, in the Sport quattro’s case, could offset its 
                understeer issue if driven properly. This was no easy task as the drivers had to push harder and aggressively 
                “flog” the car through the corners for this to take effect. It was reported that the car still suffered from 
                terminal understeer in low speed corners and/or if driven too cautiously.The drivers had also complained of glare 
                in the windshield of the original quattro so the engineers took the opportunity of the car’s redesign to address 
                the problem with a very original solution: since the chassis had to be cut in half to shorten the wheelbase, they
                married the rear section of the quattro with the front section of the Typ-81 (Audi 80/4000) which had the windshield 
                already set at a steeper angle, thus eliminating the glare effect. The new Sport quattro S1 also featured 
                an upgraded all aluminium 20V turbo engine capable of easily producing 450 BHP. However, it was also more “peaky”, 
                making the most of its horsepower in the very high RPM range, which made it ever more difficult to drive on top of 
                its already twitchy handling. This led Audi Sport to develop a closer ratio 6-speed transmission then later the Porsche 
                derived “PDK” unit to help keep revs high and shifts quick. This could provide substantial cumulative time savings over 
                the course of rally stage where shifts are very frequent. Even though it was much more powerful and technically 
                advanced than the previous car, the Sport quattro S1 was generally not well received by the Audi drivers Michèle
                Mouton and Stig Blomqvist in particular had trouble adapting to the new shorter quattro’s features which demanded a 
                driving style not quite compatible with their own. In fact, Blomqvist would shun the S1 while he and Hannu Mikkola raked 
                up points with the “long wheelbase” quattro A2 in the WRC. Blomqvist would win the 1984 driver championship with Mikkola 
                finishing second, easily ahead of their competitors. That year, Audi would get the manufacturer championship back from 
                Lancia. However, for Audi, even though the A2 netted them more consistent results, it was decided to exclusively field 
                the Sport quattro from 1985 and on.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h1>E2 UPGRADE</h1>
            <p>In early 1985, Peugeot continued its domination with the 205 Turbo 16 while the more powerful Audi Sport quattro S1 still struggled to 
                match pace. Much more improvements were evidently needed if Audi had any hopes of winning at all. In but a few months time, Audi  
                Sport developed the second evolution of the Sport quattro with striking aerodynamic enhancements. It was the first time that rally 
                engineers created a bodywork package aimed directly at gaining more traction with various spoilers and appendages, as opposed to just
                gaining stability. In doing so, Audi had created an iconic rally machine that instantly came to symbolise the very image of Group B 
                in most people’s minds; the immortal E2
                Much work was done in conjunction to help the weight distribution of the car as everything that could be moved in the trunk/boot area 
                was relocated there; engine coolant radiator, oil cooler, transmission cooler, and even the alternator which was now driven by a small pump motor. The result yielded weight bias up to F51/R49% depending on the setup used. This procedure also much uncluttered the engine bay which allowed for quicker access to key mechanical components.
                The engineers at Ingolstadt did not rest there as the 5-cylinder turbo aluminium engine was improved yet again. Much of the work was 
                concentrated in making more torque in the mid-range with the possibility of even more horsepower as well: as much as 590 BHP was 
                reportedly used in that year’s Finland event. The centre differential was also “liberated” from its constant 50/50 ratio split with
                the use of a Torsen unit with a Ferguson Formula
                (FFD) viscous coupling. This finally allowed a variable torque split between the front and rear axles and much aided the car’s 
                handling.
                Rally ace Walter Röhrl, who played an important role in the Sport quattro E2’s testing and development, describes it as one of
                the most intense machines he ever got to drive: 
                “With this car, you have to think two corners ahead finding the correct balance between a decent pace and outright speed 
                was a big challenge.”
                , he fondly recalls. Röhrl, unlike some of his teammates, was more than willing to adapt his driving to the car’s indomitable
                demands, and gave the E2 its only WRC win at the 1985 Sanremo rally. This amazing effort has since been immortalised in a
                well known animated gif:
                In contrast, Stig Blomqvist still didn’t like where Audi was going with the car and, before the end of the season, he had
                already signed up with Peugeot for 1986. That move infamously led Audi to put him on the sidelines for the rest of the 
                1985 WRC season. Blomqvist stated years later that his perfect Group B car would have been a “long wheelbase” A2 quattro 
                but with the E2’s very much improved and brutal mechanical components.
                Sadly, Audi’s efforts at keeping the quattro a contender for the titles was to be in vain as the Peugeot 205 T16 still 
                largely dominated 1985. This lack of success prompted some questionable decisions within Audi Sport, then led by Roland Gumpert, 
                as they were accused of cheating in the year’s Ivory Coast rally (by allegedly switching Michèle Mouton’s badly damaged S1 with a 
                chase car). Some insiders saw this as an act of desperation by Audi to keep the quattro competitive at all costs. Albeit it was never 
                proven, Gumpert lost his position within the company soon afterwards.
                To make matters worse, Lancia unleashed the infamous Delta S4 at the end of the season which immediately brought the 
                Italian team successive victories. For 1986, Ford was on its way with the  and the level of competition would show no sign 
                of letting down. Even though Audi was planning a rumoured 1,000 BHP version of the Sport quattro, all rally insiders agree 
                that no amount of extra horsepower in such a car would have made Audi get its domination back.
                Ultimately, the Sport quattro E2 would participate in only six WRC rallies before Audi decided to pull out of Group B 
                rallying due to the spectator deaths at the 1986 Portugal event. For Audi’s top management, this unfortunate accident gave 
                them a perfect way out of an unsavoury future in the WRC while somewhat saving face at the same time.
                Everyone will forever fondly remember the quattro’s exploits and the unmatched spectacle of the Sport quattro E2. It may 
                ultimately not have been the fastest around a rally stage but it was certainly the most exciting rally car to see and hear. 
                Group B’s legendary status would be much less known and appreciated today if not for this car.
                The rally quattro’s story did not end there as Audi also built a special version of the car based on the E2’s aerodynamics 
                specifically for the 1987 Pikes Peak hill climb event: a gambit to try and make the quattro a winner one final time in the dirt.
