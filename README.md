# Car-Website
Create a website in groups not exceeding 3. About a car or line of cars you both would like to choose. The project will be documented and turned in using github and a single repository in which group members are collaborating. Remember that the commit notes should be as detailed as possible as the commits and the note will be used to verify participation and contributions to the project (which will affect individual grades).  The website is to be 3 or more pages, detailing the subject(s), make, model, production years, specs, options, history of the line or car, type of vehicle, and other specifications....etc  The purpose of the website is between a tribute page to the car(s) or selling the car. The purpose must be apart of the content in the page and should be easily discernible. Meeting the requirements will only get you a 75% the last 25% will be on how you showcase the skills you have learned so far.  **Note: -any vehicle with 2,3 or 4 wheels, tanks are allowed(2 tracks) - if you choose and old car(s) make a site that is appropriate for the time, and you can use  ***Extra Credit for showing off your skills
