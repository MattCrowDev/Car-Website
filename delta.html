            <h3>"function over looks"</h3>

            <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
            <p>
                In 1982, Lancia’s brand new Group B contender was the Rallye 037 which sported the classic rear-wheel drive layout. At that point in time Audi was still struggling to get better reliability and dry performance out of their Quattro. In fact, with the rear wheel drive car, Lancia was able to clinch the 1983 WRC championship away from Audi. However, it was very clear that the ever improving Audi had left the 037 struggling to match pace in many events. In May of 1983, Lancia managed to convince the Fiat management that they had no choice but to come with a four-wheel drive rally car design of their own.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h1>HISTORY</h1>
            <p>
                The task of designing the new rally car would again be undertaken by Abarth even though the team had no prior experience in four-wheel drive systems and chassis. Originally code-named the “SE038 project”, the dedicated design would sport a fully tubular space-frame construction directly evolved from the 037’s and would retain much of the latter’s features such as a mid-engine layout and lack of a rear bumper replaced by large roll-up mudflaps.
                Since Group B had skyrocketed the popularity of rallying, Lancia decided that the new rally car should emulate the mass-produced Delta model for marketing purposes even though the normal production car was front-engine with front-wheel drive. This effectively changed the name of the car to the Delta S4 (S= Supercharged 4 = 4WD). While the original road car (stradale) design retained the Delta’s rear tail lights, the racing (corse) version utilised simpler units sourced from a Fiat van. The headlights were also changed in favour of conventional round projectors units from the first generation Fiat Ritmo for ease of servicing / replacement. The only other components that the Delta S4 shared with the normal Delta was the front windscreen and grille.
                Unlike before, Abarth designed an all new F1-inspired engine especially for the new rally car. It was built very lightweight but incredibly balanced with a rev range up to 10,000 RPMs. Abarth also introduced a new feature to its engine that combined both supercharging and turbocharging (sometimes called “twin-charging” or “double supercharging”). This was to improve torque across the entire RPM range and also help reduce turbo-lag at lower revs to improve throttle response on tight rally stages. The system was incredibly complicated since electronic controls were not advanced enough at the time. As such, Abarth’s twin-charging setup relied on pneumatic actuators and release valves. 
                The prototype “233 ATR 18S” engine was ready for testing before the first rolling chassis of the Delta S4 had even been completed. As such, the Abarth engineers crudely modified the rear section of a Rallye 037 to help mimic the S4’s exterior features. Due to its unique appearance, the prototype was nicknamed “Mazinga” (for the Japanese anime character). The exercise provided some much needed data.
                The test drivers reported a great increase in both horsepower and torque but found some weaknesses in the exhaust system and heat management. The engine was also reportedly too powerful for the rear-wheel drive chassis which made the car very difficult to drive, hence confirming the need for a new-four wheel drive design. The fitment of such a system to the 037 had been denied by Lancia’s management despite the pressing efforts of chief design engineer Sergio Limone.
                Neither Lancia or Abarth had any experience in four-wheel drive systems, the former having relegated development of a prototype Delta 4×4 road car to Italdesign in 1982. The latter’s part-time system was however rejected by Abarth’s engineers for the Delta S4. Lancia and Hewland thus joined forces to develop the transmission and transfer case with both front and rear differentials of ZF limited-slip type.
                The “magic” that made the S4’s four-wheel drive system truly work came in the form of a planetary centre differential equipped with a viscous coupling (VC) developed and supplied by Ferguson Formula Development (FFD). The front differential could however be disengaged to make the car purely rear-wheel drive – this option was never actually used in rallies as later tarmac testing showed better overall performance from four-wheel drive with its settings largely biased towards the rear (75%).
                Despite the extra weight of four-wheel drive, the Abarth engineers made use of a smaller displacement 1759 cc engine which meant that, paired with the FISA multiplication factor of 1.4 for forced induction, it would efficiently put the car in the 2000~2500cc class that permitted the Delta S4 to weigh as little as 890 kg (1960 lbs). This led the engineering team to go to great lengths to make the final car as light as possible.
                Some initial safety concerns were put forward by the engineers’ use of fairly small diameter tubing for the car’s space-frame construction paired with a cabin made out of composite panels and very thin bodywork parts. However, Abarth engineers were one of the first rally teams to rely on computer assisted torsion and bending figures and tests. Much reinforcement was thus implemented from the chassis’ original design thanks to those tests.
                The prototype was extensively tested while disguised as a military vehicle to fool onlookers. The resulting tests revealed that, although the car could weigh as little as 890 kg / 1960 lbs (per the class rules), the chassis and brittle bodywork were not strong enough to withstand repeated abuse. As such, reinforcements had to be made to both aspects of the car to make it reliable enough for competition. In actual rally form, the resulting strict minimum race weight was 950 kg / 2100 lbs for tarmac events. Further reinforcements had to be made for tougher dirt rallies which resulted in a 1050 kg / 2315 lbs race weight.
                The bodywork of the S4 can be considered as one of the most “function over looks” of all the Group B cars. It was developed around many hours of wind tunnel testing of various versions of aerodynamic appendages. This kind of extensive development and testing was seldom seen for a rally car. The final design was made out of light carbon/Kevlar composite, which was a rather new and expensive material at the time. The doors were hollow to reduce weight, sporting a thin Kevlar outer skin, and composite acrylic windows.
                Both front and rear sections of the bodywork could open up in a “clamshell” fashion and could also be rapidly removed for ease of servicing. The bonnet features a vent with a Gurney flap to aid in radiator cooling and could be opened independently from the rest of the clamshell to allow even quicker access to the spare tire. The rear section features large side scoops to feed both intercoolers (one for the supercharger and turbocharger systems respectively). The roof scoop provided fresh air for the intake and oil cooler. A large flexible front air dam paired with a deflector roof spoiler aided aerodynamics. The car is considered to be the most technically advanced spaceframe rally car of its day.
                However, the Delta S4 was not without its faults; it often had to undergo chassis repairs and full rebuilds after each rally, which made it questionable for rougher endurance events. The theory was confirmed when Lancia chose to use the old and proven 037 for the Safari rally. The crews also often complained that the cabin would get very hot due to heat radiating from the engine positioned right behind the seats and from the transmission that was in between the seats. As such, most of the rally cars were fitted with extra heat-reflective mats, hiding some of the cabin’s bare composite panels. Another serious problem was that the accelerator pedal could eventually get stuck in the composite floorboard after the latter would crack from repeated abuse.
                The Lancia Delta S4 extensive weight minimising philosophy would ultimately lead to disaster when driver Henri Toivonen and co-driver Sergio Cresto crashed their car at the 1986 Tour de Corse. The car inexplicably flipped over the stone wall, rolled down the rocky embankment through some bushes, got hanged in some trees, and caught fire. The accident had no witnesses close enough to clearly see the event but some reported hearing an explosion and seeing a huge ball of fire shooting up from the treeline. The main theory is that, when the Delta S4 fell into the trees, branches punctured the thin aluminium fuel tank which, by the car’s design, was rather dangerously positioned partly under the front seats, and that a hot mechanical part ignited the petrol. The team had removed the skidplates to make the car lighter for increased performance thus leaving the fuel tank fully exposed to outside elements.
                Even though the Delta S4 competed for only about a single season in the WRC, its technology and lessons learned would serve as the basis for Lancia’s new Delta HF Integrale Group A contender: a design that became an instant winner which gave Lancia a record breaking 6-year WRC manufacturer championship winning streak (1987~1992), thus continuing on the Delta S4’s excellence.
